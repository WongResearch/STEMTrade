## Project Description
STEM Trade connects students, researchers and training organisations to ensure the development of 21st century skills for our changing workforce. Initiated as STEM industry bootcamps for senior secondary students, alumni are then able to tap into industry networks and training organisations to kick start their STEM careers through traineeships. The program tracks the progress of graduates over time as they integrate into the workforce from education and training to share their STEM success stories with future participants. The program also allows STEM research hubs to consider how the workforce could be utilised in the commercialisation of ideas and products.

STEM Trade connects students, innovation precincts and training organisations to ensure the development of 21st century skills for our changing workforce. STEM Tradeâ€™s website interface allows training organisations to connect with innovation precincts to develop meaningful traineeships and apprenticeships to upskill secondary students for the 21st century workforce.
 
Initiated as STEM industry bootcamps for secondary students co-delivered by training organisations and innovation precincts, alumni are then able to tap into these industry networks to kick start their STEM careers through traineeships and apprenticeships. The program tracks the progress of graduates over time as they integrate into the workforce from education and training programs to share their STEM success stories with future participants.
 
The program also allows STEM innovation precincts to consider how our future workforce could be utilised in the commercialisation of ideas and products.
 
The website provides a map of innovation precincts and training organisations, as well as a list of upcoming STEM industry bootcamps in the area. It provides unique logins for innovation precincts, training organisations, and individuals, allowing direct contact to get those STEM conversations flowing. STEM Trade will build a future 21st century workforce by starting today!
